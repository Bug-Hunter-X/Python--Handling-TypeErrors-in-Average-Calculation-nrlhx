This repository demonstrates a common Python error: neglecting to handle potential `TypeError` exceptions when processing lists. The `bug.py` file contains the flawed code, which fails if the input list contains non-numeric values.  The improved version, `bugSolution.py`, addresses this by using a `try-except` block to gracefully handle such situations.  The improved code robustly manages diverse input, preventing unexpected program crashes.
